    <h1> Hello and welcome!</h1><br>
 <h2> I have created this website to display some of the projects that I have made during the <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web target=_blank>course</a> at <a href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera target=_blank> Coursera </a>  by the <a href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University target=_blank>Duke University</a><br>  about the basics of  HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am going to comment on the new technics I have learned throughout<br> the course  and explain my actions on some of my choices.<br>
  <br><br> The first HTML-element I worked with was the canvas.<br>I styled the two canvases with CSS and gave them a size, a color and an id.<br>
    The buttons below run functions which refer to the ids of the canvases and change their colors.<br><br>
  </h2>
  <h2><em> change the color </em></h2>
  <canvas id="canvas1" class="x">
  </canvas>
  <canvas id="canvas2" class="y">
  </canvas>
  <div>
    <input type="button" value="change color" onclick="change()">

    <input type="button" value="reset color" onclick=changeback()>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>After that I have learned about colorvalues and how they are defined in a computer.<br>
    With the color picker you can choose every color a computer is able to display. <br>I even used it to set colorborders for the filters later on.<br><br>
  </h2>
  <div>
    <h2><em> choose your favourite color </em></h2>
    <canvas id="canvas3"> </canvas> <br>
    <input type="color" value="#001A57" id="clr" onchange="docolor()">
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>The next element is the slider. When the slider is pulled a yellow rectangle appears and will grow or shrink<br> depending on which direction you move the slider to.<br> At this stage, the most important thing I have learned is how to clear a canvas.<br> Every time you change the size of the rectangle the old one will be deleted and a new one is created.<br> Otherwise the rectangles would be drawn on top of each other and a difference<br> would only be visible if a bigger rectangle is created. </h2><br>
  <h2><em> pull the slider</em></h2>
  <div><canvas id="canvas4"></canvas>
    <br><br>
    <input type="range" min="10" max="100" value="10" id="slider" oninput="square()">
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2> The first more challenging part of the course was to build the following filter function.<br>
    One can upload an image and choose between the different filters. However, the first row of filters handles every image equally.<br> But i was not satisfied with that because if one wanted to use a red filter on an image with a green background, the background would turn yellow.<br> To solve this problem I created a second row of filters. I tried out different methods to change the colorvalues the way I wanted them to be.<br> As a result I set borders for the colortones and depending on how i wanted the outcome to be a different function is called. </h2><br><br>
  <h2><em> choose a filter </em></h2>
  <div>

    
    <canvas id="canvas6">  
    </canvas>
    <canvas id="canvas5">
    </canvas>

    <br>
    <input type="file" multiple="false" accept="image/*" id="foto" onchange="upload()">
    <input type="button" value="Reset Image" onclick="resetimage()">
    <input type="button" value="Reset File" id="resetfilterfile" onclick="resetfilterfile()">
    <input type="button" ; value="Clear" onclick="clearcanvas5and6()">

  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <input type="button" ; value="Greyscale" id="gs" onclick="greyscale()">
    <input type="button" value="Red" onclick="makered()">
    <input type="button" value="Green" onclick="makegreen()">
    <input type="button" value="Blue" onclick="makeblue()">
    <input type="button" value="RGB" onclick="makergb()">
    <input type="button" ; value="Rainbow" id="rb" onclick="rainbow()">
    <br>
    <input type="button" value="Greyscale 2" onclick="makeallgrey()">
    <input type="button" value="Red 2" onclick="makeallred()">
    <input type="button" value="Green 2" onclick="makeallgreen()">
    <input type="button" value="Blue 2" onclick="makeallblue()">
    <input type="button" value="RGB 2" onclick= "makeallrgb()">
    <input type="button" value="Rainbow 2" onclick="makeallrainbow()">
    <br><br>
    <h2>The last task was to create a filter which merges two images.<br> It scans the colorvalues from each pixel of the first image and if the greenvalue is bigger than the redvalue and the bluevalue<br> combined the program replaces it with a pixel from the second image.
To make sure that this filter would work as expected<br> I had to adjust the two images so that the amount of pixels are identical.</h2><br><br>
  </div>
  <h2><em> use the greenscreen filter </em></h2>
  <h4> start with the greenscreen image</h4>
  <div>
    <canvas id="canvas7"></canvas>
    <canvas id="canvas8"></canvas>

    <br>
    <h4> for best results I recommend to use these images: <a href=https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course1/example/drewRobert.png target=_blank> greenscreen image,</a>

      <a href=https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course1/example/dinos.png target=_blank> second image </a>
    </h4>

    <input type="file" multiple="false" accept="image/*" id="firstimage" value="upload foreground image" onchange="uploadfirstimage()">

    <input type="button" id="button-reset" value="Reset File" onclick="reset()">

    </input>

    <input type="file" multiple="false" accept="image/*" id="secondimage" value="upload background image" onchange="uploadsecondimage()">
    <input type="button" id="button-reset2" value="Reset File" type="button" onclick="reset2()">

    </input><br><br>
    <input type="button" value="Compose Images" id="compose" onclick="composite()">
    &nbsp

    <input type="button" value="Clear" id="clearall" onclick="clearcanvas7and8()">
  </div><br>
<h2><br><br>
I hope you had fun trying out the filters!<br>This website will expand the more I learn, so it may look different the next time you visit it.<br>
And until then stay happy and healthy :)
